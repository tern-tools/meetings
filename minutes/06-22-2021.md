# Minutes

### Skopeo PR
* [Motivation](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2020/12/02/dont-panic-kubernetes-and-docker/) for this is coming from Kubernetes.
* This work is similar to an [old PR](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/pull/712) that Mukul worked on.
    * Similar implementation but instead of providing an option for either docker or oci images on the command line in conjunction with the `-i` image cli flag, we will use skopeo for all `-i` image pulls. 
    * Keep `docker_image` class around. We still need this for the Dockerfile execution path.
* We can discuss progress and questions at next call.
