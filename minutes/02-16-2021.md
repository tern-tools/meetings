# Minutes

### Discussion on open PRs
* Rose has fully tested Alexander's open [PR](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/pull/847) and is satisfied with functionality. She will merge this week.

### Release 2.4.0
* Due to a rather large [bug](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/874) we will likely cut a release this week to pick up a fix. Will not be full 3.0.0 release but, rather, a "mini-release"

### Tern Usage Updates
* Alexander is working on integrating Tern in to ONAP's CI/CD pipeline in GitLab. Up until now Tern was scanning ONAP images locally.
