# Tern Community Meeting Minutes, 07-20-2021

## Attending
* Rose Judge (VMware)
* Patrick Dwyer (OWASP)
* Mukul Taneja (VMware)

## Agenda
* Migrating Tern to Skopeo
* [Tern support for CycloneDX SBOM](https://github.com/tern-tools/tern/issues/987)


# Minutes

### Migrating to Skopeo
* We will need to add skopeo as a dependency (not via requirement.txt, but as an actual system dependency).
* Mukul will open PR for this very soon.

### Tern support for CycloneDX SBOM
* Patrick: the PR I opened is very basic but provides a cyclondx output. Q: Are you willing to accept it? A: Yes, willing to accept. 
    * Some concern about long term maintenance as neither Nisha nor Rose has experience with CycloneDX format.
        * Patrick is happy to help when issues come up. All newer releases of CDX will be backwards compatible so shouldn’t break Tern’s ability to produce valid CDX SBOM.
* Rose will review but also wait for Nisha to come back and have a look.
